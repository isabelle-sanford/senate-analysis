            The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress, which along with the House of Representatives constitutes the legislature of the United States. The Senate is currently composed of 100 senators, two for each state. They serve staggered terms of six years.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Senate has unique advice and consent power to ratify treaties, declare war (theoretically), and confirm Cabinet Secretaries, Supreme Court Justices, federal judges, ambassadors, and other officials. It also conducts impeachment trials and, of course, makes law. It is designed to protect the power of individual states, and particularly smaller states with less representation in the House of Representatives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the amount of power and influence that the Senate wields, it is important to ensure that it appropriately represents the American people. This page is intended to show some ways in which it is falling short of that ideal.

            If you chose a set of people whose demographics accurately represented the people of the United States, it would look very different than the Senate. This section shows that hypothetical group next to the actual Senate, so as to showcase the differences between the two.

            The Senate was not created to be a body representative of the US population, but rather of the states. This was a logical step in the time of the Founding Fathers, when each state was more like unto its own country than a part of a nation. Back then, the US was a little more like the European Union is today: largely self-governed except for a few situations in which acting in concert was valuable.
        </p>
        <p>
            But that's no longer true. You probably think of yourself as an American far more readily than a Pennsylvanian or a Texan. And even as the states grow more similar and united, the range of their populations has grown more and more extreme, leading to the current situation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dotted black line on this graph indicates that on each side is 50% of the US population. 18 senators represent half of us. If fully 275 million US citizens wanted something, but none of the 25 smallest states did, those 53 million people could prevent it. That's how extreme the population differences are now.

        So the Senate isn't very diverse, and its representation isn't really equal. So what? With all the problems in the world right now, why should you care about this one?
        </p>
        <p>
        The answer is that many, many of those problems are deeply affected by the Senate. It's the most powerful governing body in the world, after all. If the Senate had more than three black members, it might be more likely to pass laws fighting systemic racism in our justice system. If more senators were women, perhaps there would be more support for childcare and women in the workforce. If Congress weren't so overwhelmingly Christian, maybe we'd have taken 'In God We Trust' off our money by now. (It was only adopted in 1956 because we were afraid of atheist Communism, after all. ) And as referenced above, studies have conclusively proven that white men do not introduce, advocate for, or pass legislation which primarily benefits minority groups nearly to the extent that those minorities do.
        </p>
        <p>
        And this problem isn't going away. Populations and parties are increasingly polarized, and we have already had a Senate majority which represented less than half of the population, in 2015. The smaller states are also generally the least diverse, meaning that even in a perfectly diverse Congress the interests of white people would be overrepresented by population.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Senate is the least diverse, least representative elected governing body in the country. That's a problem, and fix it could cut at the roots of a lot of other problems. So how do we fix it?

            The Senate currently hosts 24 women, and has only ever had 58 women through its whole history. This Senate is down from 25 women in the previous Senate, which is the highest number there have been in its history. Compared to the 50.8% of the general population that are women, this is rather lacking. This is not even better than the rest of the world: globally, 24% of national legislative body members are women.
        </p>
        <p>
                And it makes a difference: women are more likely to sponsor bills relating to education, child care, and family health. In state legislatures, they have also been found to be more effective in introducing and passing those bills when the legislature has more women in it. That is, ten women in a legislative body will do more than double the work of five women.

            The Senate's racial and ethnic diversity is... slim, to say the least. It has had so few non-white members that its official website has a page listing every senator in history who was non-white. There are only 33, in total, a third of whom are current members. The current Senate contains two Asian Americans, three African Americans, and six senators of Hispanic origin. It has no Native Americans, and because Kamala Harris stepped down there are no longer any Pacific Islanders in the Senate. (Yikes.)
        </p>
        <p>
            This makes an enormous difference to members of these minorities. Non-white legislators are more likely to introduce and pass legislation promoting or related to the interests of their particular minority, more likely to contact federal agencies on behalf of that minority, and they usually motivate members of that minority to be more politically active.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that these graphs do not currently account for people of Hispanic origin. There are six senators with Hispanic origin, which brings the number of non-white people in the senate up to 11. About 18% of Americans are Hispanic or Latino.
