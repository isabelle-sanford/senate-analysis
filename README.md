**Overview**
________________________________
Examined the demographics of the United States Senate and compared to the United States demographics as a whole.  More specifically, examined population, race, gender, religion, and age through Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, SQL, and JavaScript, to build graphs and visualizations.

**How representative is the US Senate compared to the whole United States?**

It is theorized that 70% of Americans could be living in just 15 states by 2050 and 30% of the people who live in the smallest and poorest states will be represented by 70 Senators.(1)  If Senate reform is not addressed, the under-representation among Americans will only worsen.

In the ten years since this review, we have witnessed an increase in minority representatives but who really holds the power, and does it represent the demographics of the entire nation?  Through exploring various Senate reform suggestions, can we have better representation?


**The Project**
_______________________________
Create an interactive web dashboard comparing the demographics of the current United States Senators against the demographics of the United States through visualizations with the goal of demonstrating what the representation of the Senate could be through the popular Senate Reform proposals.
