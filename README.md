# senate-analysis

## Overview

You can find the current version of the site at <https://senatereform.gtsb.io/>! It's still a work in progress, but check it out anyway. The goal of this project is to examine the United States Senate and its problems, especially the discrepancy between its demographics and the demographics of the US as a whole.

## About

This project was initially created as a group project during the USC Viterbi School of Engineering Data Analysis & Visualization Bootcamp, by Steven Brown, William Enriquez, Michelle Risucci, Isabelle Sanford, and Kosal Sieng. It has since been extended by Isabelle Sanford to its current state, including most of the words and citations, plus a complete rewrite in React. The site uses the Plotly library for its graphs, and is hosted on Gatsby Cloud. Further information and all sources can be found at <https://senatereform.gtsb.io/about>.
