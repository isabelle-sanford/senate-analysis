# senate-analysis

## Overview

You can find the current version of the site at <https://senatereform.gtsb.io/>! It's still a work in progress, but check it out anyway. The goal of this project is to examine the United States Senate and its problems, especially the discrepancy between its demographics and the demographics of the US as a whole.

**NOTE**: you may notice that the 'Solutions' and 'My Solution' pages are incomplete and unprofessional in places. Unfortunately, I cannot fix that at the moment, since the hosting service I used is shutting down, and will no longer update based on changes to this repository. Until I find another place to host it, it'll stay that way. As is, the main page is the only one which I am proud of and reasonably satisfied with.

## About

This project was initially created as a group project during the USC Viterbi School of Engineering Data Analysis & Visualization Bootcamp, by Steven Brown, William Enriquez, Michelle Risucci, Isabelle Sanford, and Kosal Sieng. It has since been extended by Isabelle Sanford to its current state, including most of the words and citations, plus a complete rewrite in React. The site uses the Plotly library for its graphs, and is hosted on Gatsby Cloud. Further information and all sources can be found at <https://senatereform.gtsb.io/about>.
