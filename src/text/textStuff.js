      The United States Senate is the upper chamber of Congress, and as such
      arguably the most important legislative house in the world. It is
      currently composed of 100 senators, two for each state. Senators serve
      staggered terms of six years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senate has unique advice and consent power to ratify treaties, declare
      war ([LINK]theoretically[/LINK]), and confirm Cabinet Secretaries, Supreme
      Court Justices, federal judges, ambassadors, and other officials. It also
      conducts impeachment trials and, of course, makes law. It is designed to
      protect the power of individual states, and particularly smaller states
      with less representation in the House of Representatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given the amount of power and influence that the Senate wields, it is
      important to ensure that it appropriately represents the American people.
      This page shows some of the ways in which it is falling short of that
      ideal.

      If you chose a set of people whose demographics accurately represented the
      people of the United States, it would look very different than the Senate.

      as to showcase the differences between the two.

      The Senate was not created to be a body representative of the US
      population, but rather of the states. This was a logical step in the time
      of the Founding Fathers, when each state was more like unto its own
      country than a part of a nation. Back then, the US was a little more like
      the European Union is today: largely self-governed except for a few
      situations in which acting in concert was valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that's no longer true. You probably think of yourself as an American
      far more readily than a Pennsylvanian or a Texan. And even as the states
      grow more similar and united, the range of their populations has grown
      more and more extreme, leading to the current situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dotted black line on this graph indicates that on each side is 50% of
      the US population. 18 senators represent half of us. If fully 275 million
      US citizens wanted something, but none of the 25 smallest states did,
      those 53 million people could prevent it. That's how extreme the
      population differences are now.

      For comparison, this is a graph of the voting population of the original
      13 colonies. (In fact, it would have been even smaller than this, since
      the age to vote was 21 at the time, but this is the data we have.) The
      biggest state was only ten times the size of the smallest - as opposed to
      the present day, where Wyoming is <i>sixty-seven</i> times smaller than
      California. And the entire voting population was smaller than South Dakota
      today.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drafters of the Constitution did not and could not have foreseen the
      enormous changes in the 250 years to come, and the Senate certainly hasn't
      faced that test of time well.

      In more recent years, the disproportionate power of small states has also
      led to increasing skews along partisan lines. Because{" "}

        over the last few decades the parties have fallen more and more along
        urban/rural lines
      </a>
      , making more populous states increasingly Democratic, each Democratic
      senator on average represents more people than a Republican senator. The
      net effect of this is that the current Democrats in the Senate repressent
      40 million more people than the Republicans, but have exactly the same
      number of seats.
    </p>

    <p>
      And that's not just coincidence - not exactly. It's not just that the
      states are the way they are and so we have to deal with that. Every
      admitted state has been deliberate, and the knowledge that it will add two
      more seats to the Senate has always been very present in the minds of
      politicians. We can see that now, with Republicans against admitting the
      District of Columbia (and Puerto Rico, less prominently) because it will
      add two almost certainly Democratic senate seats, and accusing Democrats
      of wanting it only because of those seats. Once, territories began the
      process of statehood once they had 60,000 people,
      {/* <!-- CITE --> */}
      but not only is Puerto Rico more populous than 20 states, DC, Guam, and

      Nowadays there are no objective criteria for statehood that hold up to
      scrutiny: by population, Puerto Rico is bigger than 20 states. By area,
      it's still bigger than two. By GDP per capita, DC would be ranked first in
      the nation. By opinion of those living there,

      citizens both want statehood. It's just a question of whether Congress
      thinks they should get it.
    </p>

    <p>
      This isn't just a hypothetical about DC or Puerto Rico, either. We've seen
      state "gerrymandering" in history before: the late 1800s were{" "}

      that there wouldn't be two Dakotas if not for the Republicans of Lincoln's
      day wanting to counterbalance the returning Southern states after the
      Civil War. And this isn't going away. The trend of small states growing
      Republican has been happening for sixty years and shows no signs of
      stopping, and the result is that a Senate majority might control (and has
      controlled) a minority of the population. That's not a fair system.

      So the Senate isn't very diverse, and itsrepresentation isn't really
      equal. So what? With all the problems in the world right now, why should
      you care about this one?
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer is that many, many of those problems are deeply affected by the
      Senate. It's the most powerful governing body in the world. If the Senate
      had more than three black members, it might be more likely to pass laws
      fighting systemic racism in our justice system.

      If more senators were women, perhaps there would be more support for
      childcare and women in the workforce. If Congress weren't so
      overwhelmingly Christian, maybe we'd have taken 'In God We Trust' off our
      money by now. (It was only adopted in 1956 because we were afraid of
      atheist Communism.)
      {/* cite ^ */}
      And as referenced above, studies have conclusively proven that white men
      do not introduce, advocate for, or pass legislation which primarily
      benefits minority groups nearly to the extent that those minorities do.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this problem isn't going away. Populations and parties are
      increasingly polarized, and we have already had a Senate majority which
      represented less than half of the population, in 2015. The smaller states
      are also generally the least diverse, meaning that even in a perfectly
      diverse Congress the interests of white people would be overrepresented by
      population.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senate is the least diverse, least representative elected governing
      body in the country. That's a problem, and fix it could cut at the roots
      of a lot of other problems. So how do we fix it?

      The Senate currently hosts 24 women, and has only ever had 58 women
      through its whole history. This Senate is down from 25 women in the
      previous Senate, which is the highest number there have been in its
      history. Compared to the 50.8% of the general population that are women,
      this is rather lacking. This is not even better than the rest of the
      world:

      And it makes a difference: women are more likely to sponsor bills relating
      to education, child care, and family health. In state legislatures, they
      have also been found to be more effective in introducing and passing those
      bills

      The Senate is mostly some variant of Christian, with more than half of

      Sinema) and three unknowns, whereas the US population is nearly 1/3
      unaffiliated. There are a variety of factors at play here: this is a new
      trend, most unaffiliated are younger and young people don't vote, and
