      The U.S. Senate is the least representative body of its kind in the world.
      [source, source, source] If it were a senate for a particular state, [the
      Supreme Court would strike it down as unconstitutional]. And it has been
      growing less functional for the past [X]. I go over the Senate’s problems
      in detail [on this page], so I will only briefly summarize them here. The
      senate is:
      <ul>
        <li>Unrepresentative of diversity by race/gender/religion/etc</li>
        <li>
          Unrepresentative of the US population by party (which has been growing
          worse in recent years)
        </li>
        <li>
          Unequally representative of citizens; a vote in Wyoming is 67 times
          more important than one in California
        </li>
        <li>
          Most states have become reliably only one party, which results in
          fewer resources spent there for campaigns and in Congress
        </li>
        <li>
          Smaller states get more funding per capita than big states reliably
          because of that small state bias
        </li>
        <li>campaign stuff idk</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>HISTORY</h3>
      The Senate was created in 1787 at the first and only Constitutional
      Convention. It is a result of one of the two major compromises made there,
      sharing that dubious distinction with the now-removed{" "}
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-fifths_Compromise">
        3/5ths Compromise
      </a>
      . Smaller states threatened to walk out of the convention if they were not
      given equal representation, and the Senate was the result. This was more
      palatable at the time that it is now, with the largest state being only
      about ten times the size of the smallest (it’s now [68 to 1]) but even
      then several of the Founding Fathers were deeply unhappy with it.

      <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
      The Senate has unique advice and consent power to ratify treaties, declare
      war, and confirm Cabinet Secretaries, Supreme Court Justices, federal
      judges, and other officials. It also conducts impeachment trials and, of
      course, makes law.

    This part lays out several solutions in turn for proposed ways to fix the
    senate, in approximate order of current political feasibility. Note that
    most solutions are not mutually exclusive with each other. The summaries are
    short, but this is a reasonably comprehensive list of suggested options.{" "}

    <strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>: Admit Puerto Rico and Washington D.C. to the
    Union. This is currently popular, and mainly helps diversify the Senate and
    correct for overrepresentation of white people (DC is idk 60% black, PR is
    98% Hispanic).
    <strong>Proponents</strong>: Lots of people, idk
    <strong>Feasibility</strong>: Very! Might be a bill in Congress rn? Good
    chance for happening in the next couple years What it fixes: A small amount
    of the lack of representation, particularly for racial diversity, plus their
    own taxation without representation stuff
    <strong>Partisanship</strong>: Clearly benefits the Democrats, particularly
    DC, which is some ridiculous percent blue. That’s why it’s popular right now
