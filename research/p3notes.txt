Okay so my project 2 was laying out problems with the senate even if it didn't get to some of the ones that might be most relevant for the solutions I want to lay out here. But basically I want my paper to be about senate reform: 
- Removing the filibuster - likely to be lots of work done on this already; great for a public audience but prob not interesting enough to argue for in an academic context? that's already there
- Other methods of reform - voting (see Lessig, I think?) 
- Granting statehood to DC and Puerto Rico - slightly more complex than the filibuster; somewhat less relevant to overall Senate reform
- Partly proportional representation - would be super interested in researching this one and seeing how much lit there is on the subject
- Abolition entirely possibly with the replacement of either a citizen jury (didn't someone else do something about that? partly? the climate change person - ask her for resources) or something else or nothing - read the John Dingell article in the Atlantic
- Proportional Representation voting

Other random ways to approach stuff:
- Solve the demographic problems by electing more diverse candidates -> that goes into a much bigger topic of how to get diversity in politics, why it's not there, how to fix that, etc. Which is interesting but maybe a little out of scope?
- I mean I could absolutely write a whole essay about religion and why the rampant christianity is a problem buttttt that seems like a project where I get to vent more than something that will actually be useful
- Substantially reduce the power of the Senate by reducing the power of the federal government :))))

Ultimately I want this or something like it to end up on my site, and I can do it in any format I want, so perhaps there's something to that to explore? Could be an overview providing many different - OOOH I GET TO DO SECTIONS YESSS - many different options and providing sources, credibility, etc. That's maybe a little more informational than argumentative? Go look at a law review article or something for ideas? 

1. yes it affects loads of people ebcause the senate is important??
2. solutions are some complex and some less but all with loads of effects
3. there are loads of solutions and loads of people disagree
ooh I could talk about court packing?? nah too much


What can the Senate do to increase its diversity?
What can the people do to make the senate more diverse and representative?

Should the Senate be abolished?
Should the senate be reallocated to increase its representation of the people?
