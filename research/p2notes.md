Quote from abstract:

Findings reveal that women in states with the highest percentages of 
female representatives introduce and pass more priority bills dealing 
with issues of women, children, and families than men in their states 
and more than their female counterparts in low representation legislatures.

Quote p1: 
Numerous studies (e.g., Barnello and Bratton 2007; Boles 2001; Bratton
and Haynie 1999; Burrell 1994; Carroll 2001; Poggione 2004; Reingold 1992; Saint-Germain
1989; Sanbonmatsu 2003; Swers 2002a; Thomas and Welch 1991, 2001) have demonstrated that
female legislators are more likely than their male counterparts to sponsor “women’s issue” bills
such as education, child-care, and family health legislation.
