Quote from abstract:

Findings reveal that women in states with the highest percentages of 
female representatives introduce and pass more priority bills dealing 
with issues of women, children, and families than men in their states 
and more than their female counterparts in low representation legislatures.

Quote p1: 
Numerous studies (e.g., Barnello and Bratton 2007; Boles 2001; Bratton
and Haynie 1999; Burrell 1994; Carroll 2001; Poggione 2004; Reingold 1992; Saint-Germain
1989; Sanbonmatsu 2003; Swers 2002a; Thomas and Welch 1991, 2001) have demonstrated that
female legislators are more likely than their male counterparts to sponsor “women’s issue” bills
such as education, child-care, and family health legislation.

Study on 6 state legislatures
### Quote from abstract: 
Increasing racial diversity among Democrats is associated with a transference phenomenon in which White legislators introduce fewer Black interest measures, and Black legislators share the role of bringing Black interests to the agenda. Moreover, evidence exists that increasing racial diversity among Democrats is associated with a higher number of bills sponsored by Republicans that are contrary to Black interests and with fewer such bills sponsored by Democrats.
### Quote from later:
Advocates of legislative diversity have proposed various electoral mechanisms to increase the number of Blacks and women within leg-islatures. Remedies directed at making legislatures more raciallydiverse include majority-minority districts or cumulative voting sys-tems. Given that it is primarily the high reelection rate among incum-bents that accounts for the low number of female legislators (Darcy,Welch, & Clark, 1987), term limits may make legislatures more gen-derdiverse.Some of these remedies have been challenged on constitu-tional grounds. I nU.S. Ter mLi mits Incorporated v. Thornton514U.S. 779(1995), the Supreme Court declared term limits for national representatives unconstitutional.

Quote: African American state legislators are more likely (even compared to other Democrats or other representatives with similar constituencies) to introduce measures to combat racial discrimination and boost the socioeconomic and political status of African Africans, as well as measures generally aimed at improving education, health care, and social welfare. 
Latino legislators are most active on issues related to immigration, language learning, and opportunities for migrant laborers.

## why diversity in congress matters

Quote: Lawmakers who are themselves people of color or returning veterans are more likely to contact federal agencies on behalf of these constituencies than their other colleagues. That matters because bureaucratic agencies sometimes neglect these communities. That’s what happened, for instance, in 2014, when CNN discovered that Department of Veterans Affairs employees had falsified wait-time records to cover up how long it took for veterans to get health care — resulting in deaths and deterioration as sick veterans waited to be seen.

## minority legislators matter

Quote: To summarize, on the basis of prior studies, many of which have been corroborated by subsequent research, we have noted several reasons why racial and ethnic minority legislators matter. Such legislators are much more likely to support and initiate policies backed by minorities in the mass public; their election can mobilize minorities to participate in politics; their identity can shape the outcome of elections; their emergence has altered the coalitions of the major parties; and their presence in state legislatures encourages the adoption of policies favored by many minorities.
