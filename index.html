                <p> The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress, which along with the House of Representatives 
                constitutes the legislature of the United States. The Senate is currently composed of 100 senators, two for each state. They 
                serve staggered terms of six years.  <br><br>

                The Senate has unique advice and consent power to ratify treaties, declare war (theoretically), and confirm Cabinet Secretaries, 
                Supreme Court Justices, federal judges, ambassadors, and other officials. It also conducts impeachment trials and, of course, 
                makes law. It is designed to protect the power of individual states, and particularly smaller states with less representation
                in the House of Representatives. <br><br>

                Given the amount of power and influence that the Senate wields, it is important to ensure that it appropriately represents 
                the American people. This page is intended to show some ways in which it is falling short of that ideal.

                    If you chose a set of people whose demographics accurately represented the people of the 
                    United States, it would look very different than the Senate. This section shows that hypothetical
                    group next to the actual Senate, so as to showcase the differences between the two.  <br><br>

                                    The Senate currently hosts 24 women, and has only ever had 58 women 
                                    through its whole history. This Senate is down from 25 women in the 
                                    previous Senate, which is the highest number there have been in its 
                                    history. Compared to the 50.8% of the general population that are 
                                    women, this is rather lacking. This is not even better than the 
                                    rest of the world: 
                                    <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/03/18/the-share-of-women-in-legislatures-around-the-world-is-growing-but-they-are-still-underrepresented/">
                                    globally, 24% of national legislative body members are women.</a> 

                                    <br><br>
                                    And it makes a difference: women are more likely to sponsor bills
                                    relating to education, child care, and family health. [CITE - look at 
                                    vanderbilt study refs] In state legislatures, they have also been found 
                                    to be more effective in introducing and passing those bills

                                    The Senate's racial and ethnic diversity is... slim, to say the least. It has had so 
                                    few non-white members that its official website has a page 
                                    <a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/EthnicDiversityintheSenate.htm">listing every 
                                        senator in history who was non-white</a>.
                                    There are only 33, in total, a third of whom are current members.  

                                    The current Senate contains two Asian Americans, three African Americans, and six senators of 
                                    Hispanic origin. It has no Native Americans, and because Kamala Harris stepped down 
                                    there are no longer any Pacific Islanders in the Senate. (Yikes.)
                                        <br><br>
                                    This makes an <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-polisci-033011-205028#_i8">
                                    enormous difference</a> to members of these minorities. Non-white legislators 
                                    are more likely to introduce and pass legislation promoting or related to the interests 
                                    of their particular minority, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2019/01/09/having-the-most-diverse-congress-ever-will-affect-more-than-just-legislation/">
                                    more likely to contact federal agencies on behalf of that minority</a>, and 
                                    they usually motivate members of that minority to be more politically active.
                                        <br><br>
                                    Please note that these graphs do not currently account for people of Hispanic origin. 
                                    There are six senators with Hispanic origin, which brings the number of non-white people 
                                    in the senate up to 11. About 18% of Americans are Hispanic or Latino.

                                    The Senate is mostly some variant of Christian, with more than half of 
                                    senators falling into a Protestant denomination, and the largest single 
                                    denomination of any religion being the Catholics. As you may have noticed,
                                    there is exactly one senator who calls herself 'unaffiliated' (Kyrsten 
                                    Sinema) and three unknowns, whereas the US population is nearly 1/3
                                    unaffiliated. There are a variety of factors at play here (this is a 
                                    new trend; most unaffiliated are younger and young people don't vote; 
                                    unaffiliated don't mind voting for Christians [CITE] but 
                                    <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/2016/01/27/faith-and-the-2016-campaign/pf_2016-01-27_religion-politics-overview-11/">
                                    half the country doesn't want to vote for atheists</a>), but the result at least 
                                    is obvious.
                                    <br><br>

                                    Because there are so few non-religious lawmakers, we have little research on 
                                    how lack of belief might influence their legislative actions. We do, however, 
                                    have <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/42864400 ">plenty</a> of
                                    <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jssr.12535">evidence</a> 
                                    that strength and sect of belief make significant differences to legislators' choices. 
                                    A disproportional representation, then, does have serious consequences. <br><br>

                                    And of course, it would matter far less if the Christians in Congress weren't quite so 
                                    loudly and openly Christian. [cite]

                                    (One other interesting note: looking at political parties, fully 50 of 
                                    the 50 Republican senators are some flavor of Christian. The 14 non-Christian 
                                    senators are all Democrats. For more detail on the religious makeup of Congress,

                    The Senate was not created to be a body representative of the US population, but rather of the states. 
                    This was a logical step in the time of the Founding Fathers, when each state was more like unto its 
                    own country than a part of a nation. Back then, the US was a little more like the European Union is 
                    today: largely self-governed except for a few situations in which acting in concert was valuable. <br><br>

                    But that's no longer true. You probably think of yourself as an American far more 
                    readily than a Pennsylvanian or a Texan. And even as the states grow more similar and united, the 
                    range of their populations has grown more and more extreme, leading to the current situation. <br><br>

                    The dotted black line on this graph indicates that on each side is 50% of the US population. 18 senators 
                    represent half of us. If fully 275 million US citizens wanted something, but none of the 25 smallest states 
                    did, those 53 million people could prevent it. That's how extreme the population differences are now.

                    For comparison, this is a graph of the voting population of the original 13 colonies. (In fact, it would 
                    have been even smaller than this, since the age to vote was 21 at the time, but this is the data we have.) 
                    The biggest state was only ten times the size of the smallest - as opposed to the present day, where Wyoming 
                    is <i>sixty-seven</i> times smaller than California. And the entire voting population was smaller than South 
                    Dakota today. <br><br>

                    The drafters of the Constitution did not and could not have foreseen the enormous changes in the 250 years to 
                    come, and the Senate certainly hasn't faced that test of time well.

                    In more recent years, the disproportionate power of small states has also led to increasing skews along 
                    partisan lines. Because <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senate-has-always-favored-smaller-states-it-just-didnt-help-republicans-until-now/">
                    over the last few decades the parties have fallen more and more along urban/rural lines</a>,
                    making more populous states increasingly Democratic, each Democratic senator on average 
                    represents more people than a Republican senator. The net effect of this is that the current Democrats 
                    in the Senate repressent 40 million more people than the Republicans, but have exactly the same number of seats. <br> <br>

                    And that's not just coincidence - not exactly. It's not just that the states are the way they are and so 
                    we have to deal with that. Every admitted state has been deliberate, and the knowledge that it will add 
                    two more seats to the Senate has always been very present in the minds of politicians. We can see that now, with 
                    Republicans against admitting the District of Columbia (and Puerto Rico, less prominently) because it will add 
                    two almost certainly Democratic senate seats, and accusing Democrats of wanting it only because of those seats. 
                    Once, territories began the process of statehood once they had 60,000 people [CITE], but not only is Puerto Rico 
                    more populous than 20 states, DC, Guam, and the Virgin Islands all have over a hundred thousand people. <br><br>

                <p>
                    Nowadays there are no objective criteria for statehood that hold up to scrutiny: By population, Puerto Rico is bigger 
                    than 20 states. By area, it's still bigger than two. By GDP per capita, DC would be ranked first in the nation. 
                    By opinion of those living there,  
                    <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/district-voters-overwhelmingly-approve-referendum-to-make-dc-the-51st-state/2016/11/08/ff2ca5fe-a213-11e6-8d63-3e0a660f1f04_story.html?utm_term=.4e6629923c72">
                    DC</a> and <a href="https://elecciones2020.ceepur.org/Noche_del_Evento_92/index.html#en/default/PLEBISCITO_Resumen.xml">
                    Puerto Rico</a> citizens both want statehood. It's just a question of whether Congress thinks they should get it.
                    
                    <br> <br>

                    This isn't just a hypothetical about DC or Puerto Rico, either. We've seen state "gerrymandering" in history 
                    before: the late 1800s were <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/when-adding-new-states-helped-republicans/598243/">
                    filled</a> with territories prematurely being admitted as states, or split into multiple states to get more senate 
                    seats from them. It's possible [CITE - conflicted] that there wouldn't be two Dakotas if not for the Republicans 
                    of Lincoln's day wanting to counterbalance the returning Southern states after the Civil War. <br><br>

                    And this isn't going away. The trend of small states growing Republican has been happening for sixty years 
                    and shows no signs of stopping, and the result is that a Senate majority might control (and has controlled) 
                    a minority of the population. That's not a fair system.

                    So the Senate isn't very diverse, and its representation isn't really equal. So what? With all the 
                    problems in the world right now, why should you care about this one? <br><br>

                    The answer is that many, <i>many</i> of those problems are deeply affected by the Senate. It's the 
                    most powerful governing body in the world, after all. If the Senate had more than three black members, 
                    it might be more likely to pass laws fighting systemic racism in our justice system. [cite] If more senators 
                    were women, perhaps there would be more support for childcare and women in the workforce. If Congress weren't 
                    so overwhelmingly Christian, maybe we'd have taken 'In God We Trust' off our money by now. (It was only 
                    adopted in 1956 because we were afraid of atheist Communism, after all. [cite]) And as referenced above,
                    studies have conclusively proven that white men do not introduce, advocate for, or pass legislation which 
                    primarily benefits minority groups nearly to the extent that those minorities do. <br><br>

                    And this problem isn't going away. Populations and parties are increasingly polarized, and we have already 
                    had a Senate majority which represented less than half of the population, in 2015. The smaller states are 
                    also generally the least diverse, meaning that even in a perfectly diverse Congress the interests of 
                    white people would be overrepresented by population. <br><br>

                    The Senate is the least diverse, least representative elected governing body in the country. That's a 
                    problem, and fix it could cut at the roots of a lot of other problems. So how do we fix it? <br><br>
