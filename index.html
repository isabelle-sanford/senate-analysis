                <p> The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress, which along with the House of Representatives 
                constitutes the legislature of the United States. The Senate is currently composed of 100 senators, two for each state. They 
                serve staggered terms of six years.  <br><br>

                The Senate has unique advice and consent power to ratify treaties, declare war (theoretically), and confirm Cabinet Secretaries, 
                Supreme Court Justices, federal judges, ambassadors, and other officials. It also conducts impeachment trials and, of course, 
                makes law. It is designed to protect the power of individual states, and particularly smaller states with less representation
                in the House of Representatives. <br><br>

                Given the amount of power and influence that the Senate wields, it is important to ensure that it appropriately represents 
                the American people. This page is intended to show some ways in which it is falling short of that ideal.

                    If you chose a set of people whose demographics accurately represented the people of the 
                    United States, it would look very different than the Senate. This section shows that hypothetical
                    group next to the actual Senate, so as to showcase the differences between the two.

                                    The Senate currently hosts 24 women, and has only ever had 58 women 
                                    through its whole history. This Senate is down from 25 women in the 
                                    previous Senate, which is the highest number there have been in its 
                                    history. Compared to the 50.8% of the general population that are 
                                    women, this is rather lacking. This is not even better than the 
                                    rest of the world: 
                                    <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/03/18/the-share-of-women-in-legislatures-around-the-world-is-growing-but-they-are-still-underrepresented/">
                                    globally, 24% of national legislative body members are women.</a> 

                                    <br><br>
                                    And it makes a difference: women are more likely to sponsor bills
                                    relating to education, child care, and family health. [CITE - look at

                                    to be more effective in introducing and passing those bills

                    The Senate was not created to be a body representative of the US population, but rather of the states. This was a logical step in the time of the Founding Fathers, when each state was more like unto its own country than a part of a nation. Back then, the US was a little more like the European Union is today: largely self-governed except for some situations in which acting in concert is valuable. 

                    Now, however, this is no longer the case. You probably think of yourself as an American far more readily than a Pennsylvanian or a Texan. And even as the states grow more similar and united, the range of their populations has grown more and more extreme, leading to what we see today.

                    18 Senators represent 50% of the population. More than half of the US states could want something to occur, and they might not even be halfway to a majority.
