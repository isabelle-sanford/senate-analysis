                    The U.S. Senate is the least representative body of its kind in the world. [source, source, source] If it were a senate for a particular state, [the Supreme Court would strike it down as unconstitutional]. And it has been growing less functional for the past [X]. 
                    <br>
                    I go over the Senate’s problems in detail [on this page], so I will only briefly summarize them here. The senate is:

                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Unrepresentative of diversity by race/gender/religion/etc
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Unrepresentative of the US population by party (which has been growing worse in recent years)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Unequally representative of citizens; a vote in Wyoming is 67 times more important than one in California
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Most states have become reliably only one party, which results in fewer resources spent there for campaigns and in Congress
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Smaller states get more funding per capita than big states reliably because of that small state bias
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            campaign stuff idk
                        </li>

                    <h3>HISTORY</h3><br>
                    The Senate was created in 1789(?) at the first(?) and only Constitutional Convention. It is a result of one of the two major compromises made there, sharing that dubious distinction with the now-removed [3/5ths Compromise]. Smaller states threatened to walk out of the convention if they were not given equal representation, and the Senate was the result. This was more palatable at the time that it is now, with the largest state being only about ten times the size of the smallest (it’s now [68 to 1]) but even then several of the Founding Fathers were deeply unhappy with it. [relevant James Madison quote]
                    <br>
                    <h3>SUMMARY</h3><br>
                    The Senate has unique advice and consent power to ratify treaties, declare war, and confirm Cabinet Secretaries, Supreme Court Justices, federal judges, and other officials. It also conducts impeachment trials and, of course, makes law.

                    DESCRIPTION: Admit Puerto Rico and Washington D.C. to the Union. This is currently popular, and mainly helps diversify the Senate and correct for overrepresentation of white people (DC is idk 60% black, PR is 98% Hispanic).
                    <br>Proponents: Lots of people, idk
                    <br>Feasibility: Very! Might be a bill in Congress rn? Good chance for happening in the next couple years
                    <br>What it fixes: A small amount of the lack of representation, particularly for racial diversity, plus their own taxation without representation stuff
                    <br>Partisanship: Clearly benefits the Democrats, particularly DC, which is some ridiculous percent blue. That’s why it’s popular right now

                <p>
                    The filibuster is a controversial procedural rule in the Senate. Essentially, to close debate and vote on a bill, 60 senators must vote for ‘cloture’. This effectively sets the bar for passing legislation at 60, even though bills themselves only require a simple majority.
                    <br>
                    The filibuster was an accident of history. It was the inadvertent result of [small changes to the Senate rules], only discovered [decades later], and has most notably been used to [prevent civil rights legislation]. Importantly, it can be removed or modified at any time by a simple majority. The Senate sets its own rules, and in fact there are already a few [exceptions to the filibuster].

                <h3>Make Them Talk</h3>
                <p>
                    Alter the filibuster so that it is not an automatic process and require senators to waste time talking to prevent cloture. This makes it more painful to use, less likely to be used on small bills, and importantly Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have expressed some interest in the notion.
                    <br>Proponents:
                    <br>Feasibility: Only requires 50 Democratic senators on board 
                    <br>What it fixes: Some of the current inefficiency; minority stranglehold on politics

                    There are a few ideas for reallocating Senate seats or changing the makeup of the Senate to make it more representative and democratic. One of those is [covered in detail below], but others include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Add 100 senators allocated using [MMP] voting. (This is somewhat similar to the Senate Reform Act below, but MMP voting is a whole extra layer of interesting and complicated.) – no source

                            [find source] Keep the seats themselves exactly the same, but change voting rules in the Senate such that each senator’s vote counts for as many ‘points’ as there are people in their state, and passing a bill requires getting the support of over half the total points/population

                <h3>Divide and Combine</h3>
                <p>
                    Professor Burt Neuborne, a law professor at NYU, suggests dividing states. This has precedent: five states [need link] have been created and admitted to the Union in that way, and the process is the same as any admission of a state (except that the legislature of the state has to agree to divide). Congress could allow any state with a large enough population (Neuborne suggests 20x the size of the smallest state) to divide in half and become two separate states. Using the 2010 census [note: update to 2020!!), six states would fall under this category and be able to divide. [graph??] A smaller ratio rebalances representation even more – Neuborne notes that the ratio between the largest and smallest states when the Constitution was ratified was 6 to 1, so perhaps that would be a good benchmark. (NOTE: check – probably total pop not just voting?)
                    Notably, Neuborne also points out that this solution is not particularly beneficial toward either party, though the Democrats might have a very short-term advantage. The division of Texas might give the Democrats a couple extra senators, for instance, but dividing California might allow the Republicans to pick up a seat or two. 
                    Kristin Eberhard, director of democracy and climate policy at the Sightline Institute, echoes Neuborne’s suggestion and adds combining states as well as dividing them. There are 21 states which each contain less than 1% of the national population, many of which sit next to each other. Allowing them combine would lessen their Senate representation but increase representation in the House, and become a more powerful state overall. 
                    Proponents: Professor Neuborne, Kristin Eberhard
                    Feasibility: more doable than you would expect (but still not that duable) Wouldn’t require a constitutional amendment, since this is already within the power of Congress, and could be decided on a state-by-state basis, meaning the entire nation wouldn’t have to agree

                    Going even further, we could redraw the entire map. There have been [a number] [of different] [maps] proposed over the years, but in general the idea is to create states which are both more equally-sized and more representative of cultural and economic connections. The boundaries drawn during the creation of territories or colonies are not particularly related to today’s America, and plenty of states have extremely distinct sub-areas. Eastern Oregon, for instance, [is trying to] become part of Idaho, with which it shares much more similarity than the urbanity of Oregon’s west coast.

                    DESCRIPTION: Remove the Senate entirely. This is the most extreme option, and probably the most difficult, but it would certainly fix the problems listed above. Former Representative John Dingell, the longest-serving member of Congress in American history, suggested [link] combining the two chambers of Congress into one. Other options include abolishing with no changes to the House of Representatives or replacement with a citizen’s veto. [SOURCE, also explain?]
                    Proponent(s): John Dingell, ??
                    Feasibility: Would probably require a constitutional (article V) convention, which would be the first since 178?. 
                    What it fixes: Everything, maybe! There would probably be other problems, but the opportunity to start fresh would clear the current slate pretty thoroughly.
                    Partisanship [come up with a better name seriously]: Heavily favors Democrats, because the Republican small-state advantage in the Senate makes it consistently overrepresented [link]

                    Now we get deep into the weeds. 
                    In this proposal, I will advocate for the Senate Reform Act proposed by Professor Eric Orts, combined with the pro-majoritarian filibuster from Gould et al. (both covered briefly above).

                <h3>The Senate Reform Act</h3>
                <p>
                    The mathematics of the Orts proposition work as follows. 
                    First, get our “unit” number by dividing the population by 100. (This could be another number; 100 just results in about 100 Senate seats like we have now, and the math is easy to do.) Orts uses the census estimate of 2017; since the 2020 census data recently came out, we can use more up-to-date numbers. 
                        Total resident population of U.S. in April 2020: 330,759,736
                        1% of the total population: 3,307,597
                    Next, divide every state’s population by this number, to get the ratio between that number and the state population (or put another way, the percent of the unit population that that particular state’s population is). For instance, Idaho would get 0.556, because its population is 55% of our 3.3 million unit. Florida would be 6.512, because its population is 651% of 3.3 million (or 6.5 times 3.3 million). 
                    Using these numbers, we assign Senate seats. Any number with less than one unit gets 1 seat. Beyond one unit, we round normally: states with 1.5 units or more round up to 2 seats, whereas less than 1.5 units rounds back down to 1. The results (again, with 2020 census data):
                    1 seat – 26 states
                    2 seats – 12 states
                    3 seats – 5 states
                    4 seats – 3 states
                    6 seats – New York
                    7 seats – Florida
                    9 seats – Texas
                    12 seats – California 
                    The end result is 111 senators from the 50 states. 
                    Other technical details: Senators from the 26 smallest states could be grandfathered in and allowed to serve out their terms, with the state’s second seat being removed with whichever senator’s term is up first. The seats would keep to the same staggered 6-year cycle, shown on Orts pp. 2005-2007. Senate seats would be updated the same way as House ones currently are, with the decennial census. 
                    Problems Remain: This is more proportional, but some states still have much more per-voter power than others. In general, the very smallest states still have the most disproportionate advantage, but after that it is at least somewhat more random. Louisiana fares the worst, with its 4.6 million citizens still only meriting a single senator.

                <h3>The Pro-Majoritarian Filibuster</h3>
                <p>
                    Democratizing the Senate from Within suggests a change to the cloture rules so that debate can be closed by, instead of 60 senators, a majority of the population. That is, this “nukes the filibuster” insofar as only 50 senators are now needed for cloture, but it requires a popular majority in addition to a senate majority. For instance, this would mean that in the current system the 25 smallest states could not collectively call for a bill to be voted on, even though they comprise 50 senators, because those senators only represent approximately 15% of the U.S. population.  
                    [maybe put under What It Means?] This is potentially much better than merely removing the filibuster entirely, because it guards against the consequence of minority rule – that is, nuking the filibuster is all well and good in that it gives the majority party more power and the minority party has less of a stranglehold, but that’s only more democratic and fairer if the majority party actually represents the popular majority. In the current situation of disproportionate small-state representation favoring the Republicans, this is not guaranteed. In fact, the Republican party has held a Senate majority in 12 of the last 20 years but has never represented more than half of the U.S. population in that time. Nuking the filibuster would currently favor the majority of the population (Democratic senators currently represent 56% of the US), but in the longer term it only favors the majority if the popular majority holds a Senate majority. This proposal addresses that concern. 
                    Problems remain: Doesn’t fix representation of small state problems completely, as a majority of senators is still required to pass any bill. The “fix” is that it makes representation unequal in both directions: the advantage of large states is that the votes of their senators are very valuable. This is certainly fairer than the current system, but balancing inequality with inequality is not an ideal solution.

                    The SRA doesn’t result in perfect representation. The senator from Wyoming still only represents 576 thousand people, while the Louisiana senator represents 4.7 million. But at least now the senator representing the most people only represents about 8 times as many people as the senator representing the least, as opposed to the current situation of a California senator representing 67 times as many people as a Wyoming one. 
                    [comparison graph!]
                    More equal representation makes a difference, too. Two senators do not have as much power, time, or influence as 12, and we see that reflected in the current political system. Per capita, many small states receive much more federal funding than large states, for instance. [other examples?]
                    In addition to more representation, this gives interesting choices for the larger states to elect their senators differently. States could hold senate elections with Ranked Choice Voting, which would likely result in multiple parties (and probably even more than just Democrats and Republicans) being chosen. Texas, for instance, might end up with three Democrats, three Republicans, and three Libertarians. California would almost certainly pick up a couple Republicans from its more rural areas. So not only is there more representation in terms of people per senator, but there is also more chance for people within a state to be represented by a senator they elect. 
                    A few other interesting repercussions follow from this act. For instance, it’s probable that new states would have an easier route to statehood, as all current territories would only add one senator to the 111, which is easier to stomach than 2 for the party less likely to gain that seat. 

                    This proposal combines very neatly with the Senate Reform act.

                    Orts argues, thoroughly, that his proposal is constitutional. As he is a law professor and I am decidedly not, I have left that argument to him, but you may read it [here] (pp. 2010-y). For the purposes of this page/paper, we assume that the Senate Reform Act is constitutionally viable. 
                    Filibuster reform is indisputably constitutionally viable. It would only require a change in Senate rules, which is something that the Constitution explicitly leaves entirely to the Senate, and is little different than any other change to the filibuster in recent times (e.g. when it was removed for the purposes of judicial confirmations).

                <p>
                    The Senate Reform Act is a non-partisan suggestion and does not clearly benefit either party. It likely is slightly more attractive to Democrats, because it corrects for [small state bias towards republicans], but it has its own advantages for the GOP. Splitting bigger states into several senators allows Republicans to compete in big blue states like California that they currently have no chance in. (Hey, it might also make Republicans more in favor of RCV, which would be great.) I haven’t run numbers (yet), but there’s no particular reason to believe that this will benefit either party more in the long run. 
                    
                    That said, this particular variant of the SRA is directly harmful to the interests of the 26 states which would all lose a senator. This is likely to be the largest political obstacle to the Act, and Orts suggests perhaps a Rule of Two Hundred would be more palatable, using 2 senators as a floor rather than one.

                <h3>Filibuster</h3>
                <p>
                    In the short term, the pro-majoritarian cloture rule benefits Democrats. (This is convenient, since that’s the party in power right now.) It is in fact even more to the Democrats’ advantage than simply removing the filibuster, because at present the Republican party is a minority of the population (especially with regards to which states they represent) and unlikely to have both a popular and a Senate majority. However, it is also something more likely that moderate Democrats could get behind, since it is explicitly fairer and more representative of the people. 
                    The place where this could get Republican support is if it were combined with the Senate Reform Act, actually. Republicans in Congress currently represent a minority of the population specifically because larger states tend to be blue, but if those states get more senators (plenty of whom may end up Republican and turn them into purple states), that popular majority the Democrats have goes away.
